# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation-Risk-Prediction
Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings.

The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit
scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.
Generally speaking, credit score cards are based on historical data. Once encountering large economic
fluctuations, past models may lose their original predictive power. Logistic model is a common method
for credit scoring.

Tasks:
1. Performing basic exploratory analysis on available data and graphically represent relevant
variables.
2. Building a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client. The definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given. You should construct your own
label.
